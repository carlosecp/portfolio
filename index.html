					Developer from Nicaragua, currently living in Argentina and
					studying computer engineering @ University of Buenos Aires. I'm a
					creative person, someone who is passionate about text editors, CLI
					based applications, and just programming languages overall. I'm
					also starting to fall in love with core computer science concepts
					and I'm trying to dig a little bit more into those kinds of topics.

					You can find me on <a href="https://github.com/cecp01" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="font-medium
							underline">Github</a>, where you'll probably catch me in the
					middle of one of my side projects or commiting changes to my
					development environment dotfiles (probably spending more time than
					what I should on that &#128522). Other than that, I'm looking to
					collaborate with cool people who understand I'm still learning.

					When I'm not full with college assignments I'm likely starting a
					new project. Usually something pretty small but entertaining enough
					for me. I like to build apps that help me out on tasks I perform
					daily, or grab a programming book and try to complete it while
					learning a new language from scratch or something like that. These
					are some of the projects I've built that I'm most proud about:
